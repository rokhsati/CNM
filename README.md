Fie ```"get_range_name"``` Explanation:
ip_to_num Function: The inner function converts a dotted IP address into a numeric representation. This is necessary because IP address comparisons are not straightforward as string comparisons.

Main Logic: The main function get_range_name:

Converts the provided IP address into a numeric format.
Queries the ip_ranges table to find a matching range by comparing the numeric representation of the IP address to the numeric representation of the start and end range.
Error Handling: If no matching range is found, or if any error occurs, it handles the situation gracefully and returns NULL.

Important Notes:
Make sure that your ip_ranges table contains valid data, and the start_range and end_range columns are formatted correctly to be processed by the ip_to_num function.
Depending on your Oracle version, you may need to modify the IP parsing logic for compatibility.

Sample Usage:
You can use the function in a SQL query like this: 

```SQL
SELECT get_range_name('192.168.1.100') AS range_name FROM dual;
```

This will return the name of the range if found, or NULL if the IP is not within any range.
